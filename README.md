Code Sample Guidelines

See my comment on each section of codes. This comprise of front-end and back-end application.

For Back-end, it uses PHP Laravel Passport just like JWT, which uses token based call to validate client credential before accessing Laravel controllers and models.

For Front-end, it uses VueJs with state management to separate state and use it anywhere from the code globally.
