Code Sample Guidelines

See my comment on each section of codes. This comprise of front-end and back-end application.

The code is not a complete version but I did uploaded and commented the key methods for calling user skills in database using Laravel Controller and Model using VueJs front-end.

For Back-end, it uses PHP Laravel Passport just like JWT, which uses token based call to validate client credential before accessing Laravel controllers and models.

For Front-end, it uses VueJs with state management to separate state and use it anywhere from the code globally.
